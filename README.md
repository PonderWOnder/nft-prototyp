NFT Prototyp


## Install Dependencies

```
sudo apt install nodejs
```

## install truffle via npm

```
npm install -g truffle
```

### Metamask

Setup metamask and select `localhost:8545` network.

## Run

### Start setup
```
docker-compose up
```

### Load contract into ganache
```
npx truffle migrate
```

### Setup metamask account

From the docker-compose log output copy the first private key and create a account in metamask.

#### Private Keys:
Private Keys are 256 Bit (64 Hex) Hash Values generated by Elliptic Curve Encoding. To this Purpose the Nonce, Pass Value and Message Digest are fed into the keccak256 Function. Therefore Private Keys are pseudo-randomly generated Values that are the Corner Stone of Ethereum Encryption.

#### Public Keys:
Derived from the Private Key, Public Keys are asymmetrical 160 Bit (40 Hex) Derivatives of the secret Private Key. This means they can be deduced by the Private Key and all Messages encode by the Private Key but can not be used to determine the Private Key or encode Messages in a similar Way. This is very helpful to determine the Identity of an Message Sender since only the Holder of the secret Private Key can have signed a Message showing the corresponding Public Key.



## Misc
### Exec into ganache container

```
docker exec -it nft-prototyp_node_1 /bin/sh
